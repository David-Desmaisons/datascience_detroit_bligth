Identifying buildings at risk of being abandoned is becoming a point of interest for US cities such as Detroit, in order to be able to 
take action to prevent these events to happen. 

In this study, I created a model to predict if a building in Detroit will be blighted using data provided by Data Driven Detroit such 
as criminal incidents, permit violations, call to 311 and blight information. I also used additional demographic information such 
as median population income, median house value and racial information. Using machine learning, I was able to build a model that 
predicts building blighting with an accuracy of 0.96 and an area under ROC of 0.96.

Interestingly, this study shows the importance of spatial environment in building abandonment as neighborhood parameters were found 
to be more important in the predictive model than information related to the building itself.
